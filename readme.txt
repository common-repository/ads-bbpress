Injects ads code (and more) on bbPress pages (top, bottom and between topics and replies)

== Description ==

Injecting ads inside the bbPress generated pages has never been so easy!

You can add whatever JavaScript and HTML code you want on top and bottom of each page and between topic and reply lists.

Interleaving ads between replies if the best way to monetize your forum. 

Adding custom messages on page footer, you can easily invite user to sign up to participate the discussion. 
Or, using a shortcode, display a sign up/sign in box (there are plugins that provide those kind of forms).

And why not briefing the forum rules just before the new topic or new reply forms?

Injection points:

* before and after the single forum page where all topics are listed
* before and after the single topic page where all replies are listed
* before the new topic and the new reply form (pretty useful to give evidence to your forum rules)
* between the topics and the replies blocks (perfect to inject advertisement)
* just before and after the single reply text (maybe not very useful)

= Test mode =

In test mode the administrator can surf the forum and find out all injection areas and then configure them from the setting panel. Cannot be easier than that.

= Syntax highlight =

Using Code Mirror as editor, you have the syntax highlight for your JavaScript, HTML and PHP which makes it easy to edit and check the code. 
There is even the autocompletion for some tags!
